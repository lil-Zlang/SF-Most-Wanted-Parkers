## 🎨 UX Improvements Needed

### Critical UX Fixes

1. **Search-First Design**
   ```
   Big search bar: "Where are you going?"
   → Shows safe parking near that address
   → Not: browse the whole city
   ```

2. **Mobile-First**
   - 80% of parking searches happen on mobile
   - One-tap "Navigate to this spot"
   - Quick actions: Save, Share, Navigate

3. **Contextual Information**
   ```
   Current: "2 citations here"
   Better: "2 citations, but only during events
            Last ticket: 6 months ago
            Safe to park: ✅"
   ```

4. **Onboarding Flow**
   - "Where do you usually park?" → Show personalized spots
   - "What times do you park?" → Filter by schedule
   - "Save your favorite spots" → Build habit

### Visual Design Improvements

1. **Heat Map Alternative**
   - Cluster similar spots
   - Show "zones" not individual markers
   - "This neighborhood is 85% safe"

2. **Smart Filters**
   - Time of day slider
   - Day of week toggle
   - Violation type (street cleaning vs. metered)
   - Distance from destination

3. **Quick Actions**
   - "Planning ahead" mode (pick date/time)
   - "Parking now" mode (real-time)
   - "Compare spots" mode
